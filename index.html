            There’s a new natural predator in New York City, and the 
            government wants us to kill it. Can we summon the resolve?

            <p>
               On a recent weekend afternoon, Damian Biollo went to Hudson 
               Yards with his wife to meet up with a drawing group that 
               typically convenes in Central Park, where the mysteries of 
               nature reveal themselves more reliably. On this day, a 
               mall-cum-office park would dubiously provide the inspiration, 
               but not long after they arrived, they noticed something out of 
               context and quite beautiful — a tiny creature with two pairs of 
               wings, the front set a pale gray elegantly dotted in black, and 
               the back set smaller and accented in bright red. It had situated 
               itself near an entrance to the High Line.
            </p>
            <p>
               Someone without Mr. Biollo’s particular grasp of the moment
               might have simply begun sketching what looked like a detail 
               of an exquisite Chinoiserie wallpaper, but he knew that he was 
               in the presence of something insidious. After two attempts, he 
               managed to squash it.
            </p>
            <p>
               A software engineer who follows a lot of naturalists online, 
               Mr. Biollo correctly identified what he was looking at as a 
               spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula), an invasive pest from 
               Asia that arrived in the United States seven years ago and in 
               New York City last year, immediately landing on the Most 
               Wanted list of local environmentalists, who have brought a 
               General Patton-ish energy to the project of expunging it.
            </p>
            <p>
               “I spent 10 minutes stomping around and looking for them, 
               and I killed eight,” he told me. That day, in a confined 
                area around 34th Street toward 11th Avenue, they were 
               everywhere. Over the course of two hours, he killed 
               76 — 40 of them in a span of just a few minutes. “I 
               honestly felt like I was in a twisted video game,” he said. 
               “I killed eight and I thought maybe I could get to a high 
               score of 10.”

                Mr. Biollo understood that the lanternfly is a problem for 
                many reasons, but mostly because it zealously feeds on the 
                sap of more than 70 plant species, leaving them susceptible 
                to disease and destruction from other natural antagonists, 
                hreatening to set back the fight against climate change. In 
                Pennsylvania, the issue is taken so seriously that the state 
                issued a <a href="https://www.agriculture.pa.gov/Plants_Land_
                Water/PlantIndustry/Entomology/spotted_lanternfly/quarantine/
                Documents/Quarantine%20Spotted%20Lanternfly%20Final%203.1.
                2021.pdf" target="_blank">Spotted Lanternfly Order of Quarantine and 
                Treatment </a>, 
                which imposes fines and even potential criminal penalties on 
                anyone who intentionally moves the bug, at any stage of its 
                life, from one sort of location to another via “recreational 
                vehicles, tractors, mowers, grills” as well as “tarps, 
                mobile homes, tile, stone, deck boards” or “fire pits.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The insects hop and fly only short distances, but they 
                move with ease and reproduce maniacally. “They can hitch 
                a ride on a baseball cap in the back of your car,” Ronnit 
                Bendavid-Val, the director of horticulture at the <a 
                href="https://www.bbg.org/" target="_blank">Brooklyn 
                Botanic Garden</a>, told me. “I can’t think of something they 
                don’t lay their eggs on — cloth, metal, furniture, sides of 
                buildings and of course trees.” There are no natural predators 
                that go after them, no organic pesticides to shut down their 
                operation, so if you see one, “squish it,” Ms. Bendavid-Val 
                said, “that’s the message.”

                New York State’s Department of Agriculture, concerned about 
                the lanternfly’s affinity for grapes and all the resulting 
                danger posed to vineyards in the Finger Lakes and on Long 
                Island, would ask you to go beyond combat and perform 
                reconnaissance. It would like you to collect a specimen 
                when you come across one, put it in a bag and freeze it 
                “or put it in a jar with rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer,” 
                the purpose of which, other than making use of the extra 
                Purell you bought over the past 18 months, is not entirely 
                clear though the goal — death — will be achieved. Once you 
                have made the lanternfly your victim, you are meant to write 
                to the agency providing additional details about your 
                sighting, pointing out the “street address and ZIP code, 
                intersecting roads, landmarks, or GPS coordinates,” according 
                to the website.

                You might abide these directives, hunt down this creature, 
                pulverize it and feel like a warrior, but still you would 
                be forced to recognize the insect’s natural gift for metaphor.
                The spotted lanternfly made its way to New York City in the 
                middle of a pandemic, arriving first in Staten Island, 
                going after our ecological cohabitants. Chief among them 
                turns out to be the Ailanthus altissima, otherwise known 
                as the Tree of Heaven, otherwise known as the tree at the 
                center of the 1943 novel “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.” Itself 
                aggressive and a symbol of urban resilience, “it grew in 
                boarded-up lots and out of neglected rubbish heaps,” the 
                author Betty Smith wrote. “It was the only tree that grew 
                out of cement.”

                The presence of the lanternfly brings us another reminder 
                that our commitments to sustainability are all too 
                frequently in conflict with our aesthetic values. The 
                last time the city faced a threat of this kind was 
                approximately 15 years ago, when the Asian long-horned 
                beetle made its incursions, having entered the country in 
                wooden packing materials. Half of the trees in New York were 
                vulnerable to it, and the invasion resulted in a huge 
                deforestation. First sighted in Brooklyn in 1996, the beetle 
                wasn’t fully eradicated from the city <a href="https://www.
                aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/news/sa_by_date/sa-2019/alb-
                ny" target="_blank">until</a> 23 years later.

            <p>
                Those elimination efforts were strategic, relying less on an 
                army of citizen mercenaries who might have been more likely 
                to stomp out the beetle because it was ugly than they would 
                violate something as dazzling in its appearance as the spotted 
                lanternfly. “People are feeding feral cats in the pandemic,” 
                the urban ecologist <a href="http://www.nycbotanist.com/about"
                target="_blank">Marielle Anzelone</a> pointed out. “Meanwhile, 
                feral cats are slaughtering songbirds. But people understand 
                what domesticated pets are, and they feel sorry for them,” 
                she said. “The majority of humans are not ecologically 
                literate.”
            </p>
            <p>
                To Ms. Anzelone, the founder of <a href="https://www.
                nycwildflowerweek.org" target="_blank">NYC Wildflower Week</a>, 
                which showcases the roughly 800 plants native to New York City, 
                all of the sudden interest in the spotted lanternfly is simply 
                another indication of our blinkered approach to managing our 
                ecosystem, singling out one villain when we ought to be 
                thinking holistically. “Because we have a wine industry in 
                New York State, there’s a lot of concern,” she said. “As soon 
                as there’s a commercial dollar sign involved, there’s 
                attention. But there are a lot of invasive plants in New 
                York City that are more destructive.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Even in the midst of the climate crisis, biodiversity is 
                not taken seriously in a place where nature is generally 
                regarded as a novelty. Researchers are currently working 
                on innovative methods to permanently control the spotted 
                lanternfly population. But once they succeed, of course, 
                something else will inevitably take its place, another tiny 
                enemy escaping its original habitat on a container ship. The 
                pace of global commerce and life makes it impossible to 
                imagine otherwise.
